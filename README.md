# Go
Golang
Go is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language. Programs are assembled by using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. 
Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing and CSP-style concurrency.
